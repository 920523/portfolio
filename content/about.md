About this website
==========================

This website was built as part of the course [Technical Web Design and Usability](https://www.bth.se/utbildning/program-och-kurser/kurser/20212/B3NU9/) at Blekinge Institute of Technology. It is made up of HTML, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (a CSS extension language) and [Pico](https://picocms.org/), a flat file CMS. The site also uses some php and javascript to enable some minor functionalities.
