Design Principles
=======================

This is a report on the use of design principles on three websites.

Selection
-----------------------

For this report I chose the personal websites of [Tamara Sredojevic](https://www.iamtamara.design/), [Muhaimina Faiz](https://www.thecraftaholicwitch.com/) and [Roman Serebryakov](https://www.roman-loves.design/). They were found on different inspirational blogs listing personal websites. I chose these sites since they are quite different from each other, yet share some design traits.

Results
-----------------------

### Tamara Sredjovic

Tamara is a UX designer. The purpose of her website is to market herself and the services she provides within accessible web design.
It uses a one page design with a few pastelle colors on a background of grey with a hint of pink.
The design is coherent with the values stated in the text. Stylish, spacious and with enough contrast it is highly readable and easy on the eyes, leaving a professional impression as a result.

Additional to color, line is one of the design principles used across the site to compartmentalize content - dashed lines for links and underlining and thicker information banners separating different sections of the website instead of having it divided into different pages.

### Muhaimina Faiz

Muhaimina loves all kinds of crafts and DIY projects. The purpose of her website is to inspire others and create a following of her newsletter.
The website is designed as a traditional blog and is likely a few years old although it's full responsive. The design is easy to navigate and uses carefully curated content where. The thumbnails all contain bright colors giving a creative feel suitable for the purpose of the website. 

The clearest example of the use of design principles is line. Lines in the form of thin drop shadows, borders and difference in background color of adjacent content. A combination of line and negative space is used in the gutters (the space between the columns) acting as dividers of content. This is consistent throughout most pages of the site.

### Roman Serebryakov
<img src="%assets_url%/img/roman.png" alt="roman" class="screenshot-full">
Roman is a UI/UX designer. His website is a portfolio displaying his work and inviting to connect for future engagements.
The design is light, bright and white - except for the three main colors purple, orange and red. These are used sparingly across the site, making certain elements stand out. Another way of achieving this is through animations. Some elements follow the cursor and some animate when hovered over. 
The user experience is straightforward and it seems easy to get into contact with Roman. 

The use of design principle color, the three main colors, are consistent throughout the website, adding to the cohesiveness.

Conclusion
-----------------------
All three websites use a number of design principles - too many to cover in this report. Many websites probably use a set of design principles unknowingly by emulating what is known throughout the brief history of web design. However, one conclusion is that all three websites use color as a way to accentuate certain elements. To some extent they all succeed to fulfill their purposes. The two designer portfolios definitely give a more modern and design oriented look and feel compared to the crafts and DIY website. This is naturally dictated by their respective purposes - a site demonstrating design skills needs to be beautifully and contemporarily designed to maintain credibility.

Analysis of this website
-----------------------
This website also uses design principles. Lines to divide longer texts are used. It also uses color to differentiate and accentuate certain elements and make the experience cohesive throughout. Recurring colors are different shades and hues of green and a blue. The dark grey font color has a little bit of green in it and is reused in the footer background. The color of links is a lighter shade of green and the bright green color highlights links and navigation items on hover. It is also the selection color across the entire website. The avatar has a shade of blue that is referenced in the underlining of the active navbar item. The blue and green are also used as gradients in certain menu items.

Some pages use certain principles that aren't sitewide. Gallery and Technologies pages, for instance, use grid to organize its content. A design principle that isn't used on this website is motion. There are a few ways to achieve this, adding some transparency or directional lines around certain elements, for instance. This might be implemented further down the road.
