Colors
=======================

This is a report on the color choices of three websites.

Selection
-----------------------

The three websites I chose for this report are [Ritual](https://ritual.com/) - a company selling nutrition supplement products, Swedish mobile phone operator and internet service provider [Tele2](https://tele2.se/) and [All Aboard](https://allaboard.eu/) - a startup simplifying the planning and buying of train travel. The companies operate in totally different industries and markets but all have websites that were designed over the past few years, which is what I was aiming for in this comparison.

Method
-----------------------

To identify the colors used in these websites I have utilized web browser Google Chrome and its developer tools to extract info on different elements, such as color hex codes and fonts. For non-coded colors in images I have used the built-in color picker. Screenshots of the websites were captured with the MacOS built-in tool.

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin: 40px 0; text-align: center">
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #142b6f">#142b6f</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #0038c4">#0038c4</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #7b88ae">#7b88ae</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #f8d204">#f8d204</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #ffd6008f">#ffd6008f</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #ffffff">#ffffff</div>
</div>

Ritual uses sans-serif Circular as the font across the website (h1's, h2's and p's). Circular was popularized a few years ago when Spotify started using it. To make things a little more exciting, Circular is occasionally paired with serif typeface Dutch801 in certain h2's.

The color scheme consists of a narrow selection of blues (#142b6f and #0038c4), yellows (#7b88ae and transparent #ffd6008f) and white. A blueish gray (#f8d204) is also used. By using gradients in between the different colors, this strict scheme can be maintained without getting a sterile look. Another strategy keeping the different colors consistent is the use of photos with mainly blue, yellow or greyscale backgrounds or details.

The primary colors yellow and blue work well together, giving contrast to the elements of the website. The yellow adds a certain brightness to the design, but is still dark enough to stand out on its own against the white backgrounds.

### Tele2

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin: 40px 0; text-align: center">
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #001222">#001222</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #031427">#031427</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #004fcc">#004fcc</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #01a744">#01a744</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #f4f4f4">#f4f4f4</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #fff">#ffffff</div>
</div>

Using their own typeface, Tele2Sans, Tele2 are serious about their appearances. This custom font is used throughout the website and works well both as h1, h2 and p.

The color scheme is kept simple, with different shades of blue (dark #001222 and #031427 and bright #004fcc) contrasted by white and a very light grey (#f4f4f4). As an accent color, a bright green (#01a744) is used, mainly for highlighting prices of the products. The triadic relationship between the bright blue and the green color makes them pop against the dark (almost black) blue background. Subtle gradients help giving the dark blue backdrops making the impression of night skies.

### All Aboard

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin: 40px 0; text-align: center">
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #23015b">#23015b</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #ffcc01">#ffcc01</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #ff2346">#ff2346</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #e10025">#e10025</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; height: 100px; background-color: #fff">#ffffff</div>
</div>

The font used by All Aboard is Neuzeit Grotesk, a classic sans-serif typeface that has been around since the 1920's. Thanks to the use of different weights it holds well as the only font used on the website.

All Aboard primarily uses a dark blue with a hint of purple (#23015b), yellow (#ffcc01) and a pinkish red (#ff2346). They are all on the warm side of the spectrum. The blue and yellow colors are almost opposite each other on a complementary color wheel, making them appear bright in combination with one another. The occasional combination of them and the pinkish red color adds contrast to certain parts of the website, such as prices or temporary deals, helping those details stand out. These three colors are all included in different variations of the company logo, making it work with various background colors. A deeper shade of the pinkish red color (#e10025) is used for select headlines on white background, extending the possibility to use the color while maintaining readability across the website.

To give room for these intense and playful colors, white text and whitespace is also an important part of the design. Bold, large headlines in white on vibrant photo based backgrounds help giving it an exciting yet harmonious feel all the while allowing the bright colors to shine.

Conclusion
-----------------------

All three websites use a sans-serif font as their main or only typeface. None of the websites use a ton of different colors but still manage to get a dynamic and exciting expression. Most elements are quite large, letting the few colors used take place on the screen. The high contrast of the colors are used in different ways to give a playful yet trustworthy look.
