Hi! I'm August, a teacher turning web developer
==========================
<div class="paragraph-wrapper">
<div class="paragraph-p">
<p>
I study fullstack web development at Blekinge Institute of Technology. For the past eight years I have worked as a teacher and IT coordinator at a upper secondary school. For many years I've dabbled in web programming and for a while now had a wish to deepen my knowledge. This year it was time to commit to it, so here I am. It's a fast paced curriculum and I learn a lot every week.

When I'm not building websites I enjoy playing basketball, going for gravel bike rides and spending time with friends and family.
